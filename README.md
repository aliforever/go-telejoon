# go-telejoon
Telegram bot framework using generics making it easier to write bots.

## TODOs
- [ ] Add more handlers for groups, channels, etc.
- [ ] Add text handler to avoid handling same thing in for loops, like registering one handler for each province for selecting user's province
## Note:
- This is a work in progress and is not ready for production use.
